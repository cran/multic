Brief description:
  multic is a collection of S-PLUS/R functions to calculate the
  polygenic and major gene models for quantitative trait linkage
  analysis using variance components approach.  multic class functions
  are provided to view multic object's data textually and
  graphically.

  Utility functions have been provided to help convert various
  identity by decent (IBD) formats into multic format.

Build environment and potential portability problems:
  Our build environment includes:
    - Operating System: Sun Solaris 9.0 (SunOS 5.9)
    - Processor Type: sparc
    - R: >= 2.2.0
    - Splus: >= 6.0.1
    - GNU g++: 3.2.3
    - SUNWspro CC: 5.5

  We will make reasonable attmpts to provide a multic package that
  will run correctly on unexpected hardware/software configurations.

  If you experience compilation issues and you are not using these
  system versions, please let us know (email addresses are at the
  bottom).  In such an email, please provide:
    - operating system version ("uname -a")
    - Splus/R version (obtained via the "version" command in either
      program)
    - C++ compiler version ("g++ --version" for GNU and "cc -V" for
      SUNWspro) 
    - entire textual output from the installation attempt
