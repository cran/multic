S-PLUS Installation ( UNIX / LINUX ):

  The multic Splus functions are written for Splus 6.0 or higher.  To
  install the software for local use in Splus, follow these
  instructions.  You will need write-permissions to the library
  directory under the S-PLUS installation directory.

  If multic is still in multic_x.y.z_S.tar.gz form:
  > gunzip multic_x.y.z_S.tar.gz
  > tar -xvf multic_x.y.z_S.tar

  Get to the src directory:
  > cd multic
  > cd src

  Create and run an Splus makefile:
  > Splus CHAPTER
  > Splus make

  Copy necessary files to the global library:
  > mkdir <SPLUS_INSTALL_DIR>/library/multic
    (where you supply the SPLUS_INSTALL_DIR)
  > cp -r S.so .Data <SPLUS_INSTALL_DIR>/library/multic

  You can then use the S-PLUS command 'library(multic)' from any S-PLUS
  session and have access to the software.

  If you do not have write permissions to the S-PLUS library directory
  or want the library installed somewhere else, just follow the last
  two steps, replacing <SPLUS_INSTALL_DIR>/library/ with the directory
  of your choice.  You can then use the "lib.loc" argument in the
  "library" command to load this library.

R Installation ( UNIX / LINUX ):

  The multic R functions are written for R 2.2.0 or higher.  To
  install the software for local use in R, run either of the commands
  below.  You will need write-permissions to the library directory under
  the R installation directory.

  If multic is still in multic_x.y.z_R.tar.gz form:
  > R CMD INSTALL multic_x.y.z_R.tar.gz

  If multic is has been gunzip'ed and tar -x'ed
  > R CMD INSTALL multic

  You can then use the R command 'library(multic)' from any R session
  and have access to the software.

  If you do not have write permissions to the R library directory or
  want the library installed somewhere else, use the -l <directory>
  option for R CMD INSTALL.  You can then use the "lib.loc" argument
  in the "library" command to load this library. See
  http://www.r-project.org for more information.  

  Installation instructions for different use may be found on the R
  project website (http://www.r-project.org).

Windows Installation:

  The multic library does not currently run on Windows versions of
  S-PLUS and R due to use of UNIX system calls.  Windows development
  is happening slowly and is not a priority. If you want multic to run
  on Windows, please contact Dr. Mariza de Andrade (mandrade@mayo.edu)
  to encourage this development.
